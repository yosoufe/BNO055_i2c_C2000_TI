# BNO055_i2c_C2000_TI
Example Integration of the BNO055 IMU into Texas Instrument C2000 TMS320F28377S

This is an example of how to usen the BNO055 with the I2C in C2000 processor. I wrote the code specifically for 
F28377S. I assume that you know what to include from where and how to your project. I used ccsv6.

I spent few days to make it work then I decided to share it to save your days. BE HAPPY :)
